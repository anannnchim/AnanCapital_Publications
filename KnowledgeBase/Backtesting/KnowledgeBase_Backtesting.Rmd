# Note

1.  Use My own method

## A) Acknowledgments

All the information contained in this document is drawn from my personal experience, as well as insights gleaned from the books written by Robert Carver.

## B) Terms

-   Testing single, portfolio and universe level

    -   Single: interaction between time series data after apply algorithm.

    -   Portfolio: interaction between fix stream of return to portfolio. Such as holding 10 stocks for a period of time.

    -   Universe: interaction between universe and the model. Given different universe, how does it affect the bottom line and how does portfolio change overtime.

-   Model = a set of rule given param ; Model = { EMA(32), EMA(128)}

## C) Things to know

### Backtesting Advice

-   Keep it simple: more complicate will lead to over-fitting.
-   Fewer alternatives: More variation, more likely to select unprofitable rule by chance. (Multiple Comparisons problem)
-   Use expanding out of sample or rolling (walk forward) with proper period
-   Don't drop rules casually: since it is unlikely to differentiate rule's performance.
-   Pull data across instruments.
-   Compare on the same return distributions: positive shewed with positive shewed.
-   Compare return relatively to benchmarks.
-   Use weighted average of rules: Single rule will lead to overconfident, and it is unlikely to prove that which one is better.
-   If correlation of two rules are more than .95 then we can drop one.
-   Drop too slow due to law of active management.
-   Drop too fast since high cost
-   Don't drop rule purely because performance.

### Backtesting Problem

1.  Overfitting

    -   Type of fitting: Explicit, Implicit and Tatic.
    -   Too much variation (too many degree of freedom) - "multiple comparisons problem"
    -   Not enough data (need more than 30 years for rule that highly correlated of 0.8)
    -   Too complex system.

2.  Survivorship bias

    -   Not consider a delisted stock.

3.  Implementation

    -   Cost
    -   Liquidity
    -   Capital limit

4.  Data correctness

    -   Mislead data: wronge price from split, XD, etc.
    -   Bias data: : single big jump

### Backtesting Approach

1.  In sample
2.  Half out of sample
3.  Expanding out of sample (anchored fitting): Recommended!
4.  Rolling out of sample (walk forward)

### Checking Robustness

1.  parameter sensitivity
2.  Lag of signal
3.  Additional slippage
4.  Include all market condition, fake crisis, weakness environment.

### Components of System

1.  Universe: tradable markets.
2.  Buy/Sell Engine: buy/sell conditions with parameters.
3.  Position Sizing: how much to buy/sell
4.  Execution: execution methods.
5.  Rebalancing period

## D) Designing System

### 1. Instrument Level through Portfolio Level

### Single Instrument Level

**Understand characteristic of trading rules**

-   Get the characteristic of instrument given param, cost, speed, objective and correlation.
-   Parameter selection: Select or drop parameter
-   Compare with naive approach: buy and hold, random entry exit.
-   Use random data

**Understand characteristic of position sizing method**

-   Compare with naive approach: standardized volatility, fix percentage
-   Apply pyramid approach.

**Analyze trading rule along with position sizing method**

-   Prove that given trading rule with particular position sizing method outperform naive.

### Portfolio Level

-   Apply portfolio level to include diversification benefits by apply it on three level: Avg of single instrument (no diversification), diversify through same asset class, diversify through different asset class.

### 2. Designing a Trading Strategy.

1.  understand characteristic of small number of variation or rule
    -   Behavior: how it behave in a paricular type of market.

    -   Characteristic: Speed, trend length.

    -   Correction among variations: Check structure - use square root of 2

    -   Cost: Check costs of max and min cost of trading

    -   Plot: window length on x with sharp ratio on y [systematic trading - page 59]
2.  Allocate forecast weight to each variation with consideration of uncertainty of sharp ratio (Real data: return)

### 3. My own method

### Position Sizing method testing

-   Use random entry and exit

1.  Test with fake and real data
    -   \% fix cash target

    -   \% fix volatility target

    -   \% fix volatility via expected sharp.
2.  Check tactic
    -   Pyramid

-   Verify performance

### Concept testing

#### 1. Outline the context.

-   Data: use fake data.

    -   partition (vary direction, and volatility)

        -   Three direction: uptrend, downtrend and sideway

        -   Three volatility: low, medium and high.

-   Initiate behaviour: explanation source of inefficiency. (risk averse)

    -   Which risk premium I try to exploit

-   State the concept: (e.g. cut loss and let profit run)

    -   What are the core principle.

-   Come up with model: (try Doncian channel or EMA)

    -   Design it according to principle.

#### 2. Design and understand characteristic of trading rule.

-   Design and understand it: get characteristic and performance. (e.g. return, behavior) given a set of partitions

#### 3. Break it: try to fail. (check robustness)

-   check robustness: parameter sensitivity

    -   inverse signal

-   find weakness: when to fail, how to fail

<!-- -->

-   compare with naive:

    -   Benchmark: B&H and random.
    -   Test all model, it must work both if the concept hold.

-   Verify with different context.

    -   Use other model to represent price.

    -   get expectation from different of 9 regimes.

-   Apply universal market

    -   [Single level vs Portfolio Level vs Universe level]{.underline}

        -   Behavior, Sharp ratio, edges, correlation, speed

#### 4. Summary

-   Explain the model and behavior, why it should work, when it should not work.

### Empirical testing

-   Use all market and longest all possible. (e.g. risk averse apply to any asset traded by human.)

1.  Verify properties from concept testing.
    -   Check the characteristic of model if it align with fake data.
2.  Test it
3.  Break it.
4.  Verify fake properties from fake data.
5.  avg. trade per year.
6.  Verify with real data: For trend from 50 days to 200 days, ema crossover system can capture around 80% of trend.

<!-- -->

C)  Concept. Want to generate symmetric outcome to asymmetric bet. (Prove that after apply algorithm, we convert symmetric outcome to asymmetric outcome.)

-   one plot, one table

-   one table

### Live testing

1.  Monitoring system performance and characteristic.
2.  Gathering feedback and send to research and development.

### 

Apply with another random price and check the result.

```{r}
price = generate_continuous_price(0.01,.03,100)
plot(price)
create_annual_performance_table(dailyReturn(price))
```
