# Note

1.  Further study
    -   Price modeling: stocastic process, random walk, white noise.

    -   Simulation: Bootstrapping, Monte Carlo.

## A) Acknowledgments

All the information contained in this document is drawn from my personal experience, as well as insights gleaned from the books written by Robert Carver.

## B) Terms

-   Testing single, portfolio and universe level

    -   Single: interaction between time series data after apply algorithm.

    -   Portfolio: interaction between fix stream of return to portfolio. Such as holding 10 stocks for a period of time.

    -   Universe: interaction between universe and the model. Given different universe, how does it affect the bottom line and how does portfolio change overtime.

-   Model = a set of rule given param ; Model = { EMA(32), EMA(128)}

## C) Things to know

### Backtesting Advice

-   Keep it simple: more complicate will lead to over-fitting.
-   Fewer alternatives: More variation, more likely to select unprofitable rule by chance. (Multiple Comparisons problem)
-   Use expanding out of sample or rolling (walk forward) with proper period
-   Don't drop rules casually: since it is unlikely to differentiate rule's performance.
-   Pull data across instruments.
-   Compare on the same return distributions: positive shewed with positive shewed.
-   Compare return relatively to benchmarks.
-   Use weighted average of rules: Single rule will lead to overconfident, and it is unlikely to prove that which one is better.
-   If correlation of two rules are more than .95 then we can drop one.
-   Drop too slow due to law of active management.
-   Drop too fast since high cost
-   Don't drop rule purely because performance.

### Backtesting Problem

1.  Overfitting

    -   Type of fitting: Explicit, Implicit and Tatic.
    -   Too much variation (too many degree of freedom) - "multiple comparisons problem"
    -   Not enough data (need more than 30 years for rule that highly correlated of 0.8)
    -   Too complex system.

2.  Survivorship bias

    -   Not consider a delisted stock.

3.  Implementation

    -   Cost
    -   Liquidity
    -   Capital limit

4.  Data correctness

    -   Mislead data: wronge price from split, XD, etc.
    -   Bias data: : single big jump

### Backtesting Approach

1.  In sample
2.  Half out of sample
3.  Expanding out of sample (anchored fitting): Recommended!
4.  Rolling out of sample (walk forward)

### Checking Robustness

1.  parameter sensitivity
2.  Lag of signal
3.  Additional slippage
4.  Include all market condition, fake crisis, weakness environment.

### Components of System

1.  Universe: tradable markets.
2.  Buy/Sell Engine: buy/sell conditions with parameters.
3.  Position Sizing: how much to buy/sell
4.  Execution: execution methods.
5.  Rebalancing period

## D) Designing System

### 1. Instrument Level through Portfolio Level

### Single Instrument Level

**Understand characteristic of trading rules**

-   Get the characteristic of instrument given param, cost, speed, objective and correlation.
-   Parameter selection: Select or drop parameter
-   Compare with naive approach: buy and hold, random entry exit.
-   Use random data

**Understand characteristic of position sizing method**

-   Compare with naive approach: standardized volatility, fix percentage
-   Apply pyramid approach.

**Analyze trading rule along with position sizing method**

-   Prove that given trading rule with particular position sizing method outperform naive.

### Portfolio Level

-   Apply portfolio level to include diversification benefits by apply it on three level: Avg of single instrument (no diversification), diversify through same asset class, diversify through different asset class.

### 2. Designing a Trading Strategy.

1.  understand characteristic of small number of variation or rule
    -   Behavior: how it behave in a paricular type of market.

    -   Characteristic: Speed, trend length.

    -   Correction among variations: Check structure - use square root of 2

    -   Cost: Check costs of max and min cost of trading

    -   Plot: window length on x with sharp ratio on y [systematic trading - page 59]
2.  Allocate forecast weight to each variation with consideration of uncertainty of sharp ratio (Real data: return)

### 3. My own method

### Position Sizing method testing

-   Use random entry and exit

1.  Test with fake and real data
    -   \% fix cash target

    -   \% fix volatility target

    -   \% fix volatility via expected sharp.
2.  Check tactic
    -   Pyramid

-   Verify performance

### Concept testing

#### 1. Outline the context.

-   Data: use fake data.

    -   partition (vary direction, and volatility)

        -   Three direction: uptrend, downtrend and sideway

        -   Three volatility: low, medium and high.

-   Initiate behaviour: explanation source of inefficiency. (risk averse)

    -   Which risk premium I try to exploit

-   State the concept: (e.g. cut loss and let profit run)

    -   What are the core principle.

-   Come up with model: (try Doncian channel or EMA)

    -   Design it according to principle.

#### 2. Design and understand characteristic of trading rule.

-   Design and understand it: get characteristic and performance. (e.g. return, behavior) given a set of partitions

#### 3. Break it: try to fail. (check robustness)

This is the process of finding how to fail, find all the possible reason why it will not works in the future.

-   3.1 Model checking

    -   check robustness: parameter sensitivity

-   3.2 Implementation checking

    -   Execution: lag and early entry and exit.

    -   Cost: add cost per trade given three type: high cost, medium cost and low cost. (empirical)

    -   Liquidity (Empirical)

-   3.3 Market checking

    -   Does trend following add value given different market regimes.

        -   Get characteristic of system: correlation, turnover.

        -   Strategy comparison

            -   Compare with buy and hold, inverse signal and random.

    -   Abnormal return: market shock.

-   3.4 Apply universal market (how it performs as a whole)

    -   [Single level, Portfolio level and Universal level]{.underline}
    -   Apply 10 stocks that 2 is winner and 8 loseer, check if system can capture two stocks on avg.

-   3.5 Tactic

    -   Pyramid

    -   Multiple rules: check if multiple is better .

#### 4. Summary

-   What are the core model and principle?
-   Explain the model and behavior, why it should work, when it should not work.
-   What are the expectation from different of 9 regimes given the model.

### Empirical testing

-   Use all market and longest all possible. (e.g. risk averse apply to any asset traded by human.)

    Verify properties from concept testing.

#### 1. Verify model behavior and properties from concept testing.

-   Check the characteristic of model if it align with fake data.

#### 2. Decide how many model to use.

#### 3. Fitting weight to each forecast or model.

### Finalize paper like: does trend following works on stocks?

### Live testing

1.  Monitoring system performance and characteristic.
2.  Gathering feedback and send to research and development.
